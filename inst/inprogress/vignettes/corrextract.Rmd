```

It is relatively trivial to create a basic correlation table in R. This tool is 
not intended to replace these methods entirely; however, it is intended to ease
the creation of an extract viewable and interpretable outside of R-Studio.

We will be working with some synthetic data from the RTU for this extract:

```{r}
head(data)
```

## Output in R

Here is the default R output of corr_extract on the example data.

```{r}
corr_extract(data, .ExcelFN = FALSE)
```

This extract performs the following actions by default:
* Correlations between ALL numeric variables
* No by group comparisons
* Correlations calculated with pairwise deletions, pearsons method, and no 
imputation
* Displays correlations, p-scores from t-test comparisons and the number of obs
* Also displays the means, raw Cronbach alphas, and standardized alphs

## By Group Comparisons

You can add a single variable to the `.ByX` parameter in order to divide 
correlations by the values of this variable. 

Here I include "school_id" as a by variable. This adds a column called
"school_id" to the resulting output that informs which group the correlations
are under.
```{r}
corr_extract(data, .Var = c("outcome1", "outcome2"),
            .ByX = "school_id", .ExcelFN = FALSE)
```

## With Variable

If you want to perform correlations between a vector variables against 1
variable, specify the single variable with `.WithVar`. See here this output
provides correlations between the "female" variable against "outcome1" and 
"outcome2". It is important to note that, when using this option, you must 
explicitly specify the `.Var` parameter.

```{r}
corr_extract(data, .Var = c("outcome1", "outcome2"),
            .WithVar = "female", .ExcelFN = FALSE)
```

## Other Usage Parameters

* .Method Method to use for correlations, defaults to "pearson"
* .Use Determines if correlations will be calculated with "pairwise"
deletions or with "complete" data
* .Round Digits to round to in final excel output
* .ExcelFN Excel file name, defaults to mycorr.xlsx
* .ExcelSN Excel sheet name, defaults to Correlations
* .Plot Boolean determining if correlation plot included in Excel
* .Stats Character vector of other univariate methods to include in
output. Defaults to "mean"
* .Prob Boolean determining if t-test probability will be displayed
* .NObs Booleann determining if number of observations will be displayed

## Formatted Excel Output

As stated before, the primary purpose of this function is to provide a formatted
excel as output. Here is some output in R and a screenshot in excel as a 
comparison.

```{r}
# R output
corr_extract(data, .Var = c("dual_lang", "outcome1", "outcome2"),
            .ByX = "school_id",
            .Impute = TRUE,
            .Method = "spearman",
            .ExcelFN = FALSE)
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
# R output
corr_extract(data, .Var = c("dual_lang", "outcome1", "outcome2"),
              .Impute = TRUE,
              .Method = "spearman",
              .ExcelFN = "corr_extract_vignette")
```
