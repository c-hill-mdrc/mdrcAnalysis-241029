# Loading Big-Five datset from psych
data(bfi, package = "psychTools")
```

The bfi dataset contains 25 personality traits on 28000 subjects. These 25 
traits are organized into 5 putative factors as part of the Synthetic Aperture 
Personality Assessment. For the purposes of this demonstration, we will be 
focusing on the first 5 items which represent "Agreeableness". 

## Items of Interest

```{r}
select(bfi, 1:5) %>%
  head(10)
```
## Process Overview

`efa_extract` starts by identifying and removing collinear response variables. 
It will then generate and report on Cronbach's coefficient $\alpha$ and perform
the factor analysis type requested. 

## Default Analyses

First we will try running the `efa_extract` on the bfi dataset and only passing
the response variables to analyze as an argument. 
```{r}
efa_extract(bfi, c("A1", "A2", "A3", "A4", "A5"))
```

Here we see the defaults used for this extract generation. 
```{r}
formals(efa_extract)
```

`.cor_use` and `cor_method` are used to specify how correlations should be 
calculated for the purposes of detecting collinearity. These default to 
`pairwise.complete.obs`and `pearson`, respectively. `cor_limit` is a numeric value
that sets the upper-bound on correlation before 2 variables are deemed to be 
collinear, it defaults to 0.8.

`.alpha_keys` can be set identically to the `keys` argument in `psych::alphas`. 
I would recommend passing a vector of variable names that should be reversed.
`.alpha_check.keys` is an alternative logical value that will automatically 
attempt to reverse items with negative loadings.

`.fa_rotate` allow you to specify what type of rotation to perform with your 
factor analysis. It is important to note that, unlike `psych::fa`, `efa_extract`
defaults to "varimax" as the rotation method. 

`fa_nfactors` will be discussed in greater depth later. It defaults to "ncol" 
which is equal to the length of the `.responses` vector passed. In the example
we just performed, we passed `c("A1", "A2", "A3", "A4", "A5")` as the 
`.responses` vector so the extract will test for a 5-factor solution. 

`.file_path` and `.file_name` are used to specify where an `.xlsx` file of the 
extract will be saved to. Although we can see here that some descritpive plots
and tables are printed into the markdown file and the returned object of the 
function also contains extractable elements, it is much easier to see all
results in the workbook.

```{r}
efa_extract(bfi, c("A1", "A2", "A3", "A4", "A5"),
            .file_path = "../example_extract",
            .file_name = "efa_extract_default")
```

## Testing Multiple Solutions

One of the primary goals of this function was to simplify testing for multiple
solutions. Suppose we just want to test for all possible factor solutions of 
this same item set. We can pass a numeric vector for `.fa_nfactors` to test
for each of these and the extract function will generate a separate excel sheet
in the workbook for each number of factors being tested. All other options and
arguments are preserved between iterations. 

Here we try running this to test on all nfactors from 1 through 5. I will also 
change some arguments from the default for demonstration.

```{r}
multiple_solutions <- efa_extract(bfi, c("A1", "A2", "A3", "A4", "A5"),
                                  .cor_method = "pearson",
                                  .fa_nfactors = 1:5,
                                  .fa_rotate = "none")
```

The returned object is a list of 5 elements, one for each factor solution. The 
name of each element corresponds to the number of factors extracted. You can see
here how each component of the analysis results can be extracted by name.
```{r}
names(multiple_solutions[["1"]])
```

Simpler than extracting in R though is just looking at the Excel output. Note 
that `.cor_limit` is reduced in this example for demonstration purposes.
```{r}
efa_extract(bfi, c("A1", "A2", "A3", "A4", "A5"),
            .cor_method = "pearson", .cor_limit = 0.5,
            .fa_nfactors = 1:5,
            .fa_rotate = "none",
            .file_path = "../example_extract", .file_name = "efa_extract_multiple")
```

Notice that this workbook has 5 sheets of output, one for each factor solution.

## Other Arguments

`efa_extract` does support passing through additional arguments for `psych::fa`.
If there is a specific `psycha::fa` arugment that you would like to change from 
the default, pass it as a named argument to `efa_extract`. For example, 
`psych::fa` default to not imputing missing values. We can change this behavior
by passing the named argument as such:
```{r}
efa_extract(bfi, c("A1", "A2", "A3", "A4", "A5"),
            missing = TRUE)
```
This can be accomplished with any arguments found in `psych::fa`; however, note 
that this function always passes data as a raw data matrix, not a correlation
or covariance matrix so arguments pertaining only to a correlation or covariance 
matrix will be ignored or may cause errors.
