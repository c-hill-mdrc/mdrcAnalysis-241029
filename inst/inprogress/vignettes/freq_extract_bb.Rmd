## Overview and Motivation

Producing a simple frequency table in R is a relatively simple task with many
different easy implementations. This function is not intended to replace simple
data checks like using `dplyr::count` or `janitor::tabyl`, rather it simplifies
the variable selection and output generation processes for the user. Here we see
the result of a the default call on the `ut` dataset:

```{r}
freq_extract(ut)
```
Here, the function automatically selects variables that have fewer than 24 
unique values to present on. It presents frequencies, cumulative frequencies,
percentages, and cumulative percentages on each unique value including missings.
This type of default call can be used in initial data investigations and
presentations.

## Selecting Variables

`freq_extract` does not currently support tidyselection of variables but 
it does allow users to either explicitly select variables to run their extract 
on. Alternatively, you can change the unique values limit in the automatic
column selection process.

### Explicit Selection

Here I explicitly select 2 variables to perform a frequency extract on. 
`cls_did_eval` has 83 unique values which would have blocked it from the
automatic variable selection process.

```{r}
freq_extract(ut, c("rank", "cls_did_eval"))
```

### Changing Automatic Selection

Here I explicitly select all binary variables. Note that `gender` is still 
included despite having 3 rows in the resulting frequency count. That is because
the missing value does not factor into the `.max_lvls` selection process.

```{r}
freq_extract(ut, .max_lvls = 2)
```

## Frequencies By Groups

We frequently want frequencies by a grouping variable. Although I recommend 
using [crosstab-extract](crosstab_extract.html) for more complex cross
tabulations, the `.by_group` argument in this function should suffice for most
simple tasks. Here I show the frequency extract on all binary variables grouped
by `gender`.

```{r}
freq_extract(ut, .max_lvls = 2, .by_group = "gender")
```

## Weighting Observations

By default, `freq_extract` weights all observations equally. If we wish to 
weight our tabulations by another column in the data, we can easily do that with
the `.wt_var` argument. Here I weight the binary variable frequencies by
`prof_eval`. Note that unweighted frequencies and percentages are aalso still
displayed alongside their weighted counterparts.

```{r}
freq_extract(ut, .max_lvls = 2, .wt_var = "prof_eval")
```

# Removing Observations

If you want to remove missing values from the extract, particulary so that the 
cumulative frequecies and cumulative percentages do not include missing values,
set `.na_rm` to `TRUE`.
```{r}
freq_extract(ut, "gender", .max_lvls = 2, .na_rm = F)
```
```{r}
freq_extract(ut, "gender", .max_lvls = 2, .na_rm = T)
```

## Exporting to Excel

The function also supports exporting the extract into an excel sheet for
distribution using 
```{r}
freq_extract(ut, .max_lvls = 3, .by_group = "gender",
             .wt_var = "prof_eval", .na_rm = TRUE,
             .output_file = "freq_extract_example",
             .output_path = "../example_extract")
```
