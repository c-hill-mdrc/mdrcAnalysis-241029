# Loading data
data(Arabidopsis, package = "lme4")
```

For the purposes of this demonstration, I will be working with the `Pastes` 
dataset from the `lme4` package:
```{r}
head(Arabidopsis)
```

```{r}
print(summarytools::dfSummary(
  x = Arabidopsis,
  varnumbers = FALSE,
  valid.col = FALSE,
  graph.magnif = 0.76,
  max.distinct.values = 5),
  method = 'render')
```



This dataset gives us the continuous variable `total.fruits`, a by variable
of `status` and 2 nested grouping levels of `popu` and `gen`.

## Basic Model Specification

`mixed_extract.data.frame` allows you to specify a mixed model in identical fashion to
how it is specified with `lme4`; however, if you are unfamiliar with this 
formula structure, you can also explicitly specify a vector of variables to use
as fixed effects, random slopes, and random intercepts. 

Here we call the extract by explicitly writing the
right hand side of the formula.
```{r}
mixed_extract.data.frame(Arabidopsis, "total.fruits", .rhs = "status + (1|gen/popu)")
```

Here we call the extract by specifying model terms using these arguments. Note
that we are explicitly passing these as named arguments. See that the extract 
results are identical. 

```{r}
mixed_extract.data.frame(Arabidopsis, "total.fruits",
              .fixed_effects = "status",
              .random_intercept = "gen/popu")
```

## Adding a By Group

In both previous specifications, we only added `status` as a fixed effect. If we
wanted to generate comparisons on this variable, we can just add `status` as the
grouping parameter:
```{r}
mixed_extract.data.frame(Arabidopsis, "total.fruits",
              .fixed_effects = "status", 
              .random_intercept = "gen/popu",
              .by_group = "status")
```
This call generates unadjusted means, adjusted means, p-values, and effect sizes 
for all levels of the `.by_group`. Note that the "reference value" for the 
`.by_group`; i.e. the the level of the `.by_group` that has an effect size of 0
is the first factor level of the `.by_group` or, when it is not already assigned
as a factor, the first value that appears. Make `.by_group` into a factor if you
want to explicitly change the reference value.

## Testing for Multiple Responses

The primary goal of this function is to simplify the creation of extracts for 
many response variables at once. Let's add a fake variable to the dataset for 
the purposes of testing.
```{r}
Arabidopsis <- Arabidopsis %>%
  mutate("total.leaves" = sample(1:20, nrow(Arabidopsis), replace = TRUE))
```

We can now pass these reponses as a vector and the function will perform the 
analysis on both and output it as a single dataframe.

```{r}
mixed_extract.data.frame(Arabidopsis, c("total.fruits", "total.leaves"),
              .fixed_effects = "status", 
              .random_intercept = "gen/popu",
              .by_group = "status")
```

## Alternative Methods

The other primary goal of this function is to be able to handle cases where a
mixed model has a singularity. Here we see the current alternate methods that
are implemented. 
```{r}
formals(mdrcAnalysis:::mixed_extract.data.frame) %>%
  .$.alternate
```

"cluster" runs the model as a linear model of fixed effects but with
clustered standard errors on the highest grouping level. For the reproducible 
example here, I create what is admittedly a very silly dataframe with 2 response
variables: `y` and `y1`, a by group: `x` and a grouping level `condition`. 

```{r}
singular_dataset <- tibble(y = c(4, 7, 4, 7),
                           y1 = c(4, 4, 7, 7),
                           x = c(1, 2, 1, 2),
                           covar = c(1, 2, 3, 4),
                           condition = c("A", "A", "B", "B"))
print(singular_dataset)
```

I then run mixed_extract.data.frame on this data. Note that it automatically uses a 
clustered linear model for the dependent variable of `y` but uses a mixed model
for `y1`. This occured because it detected a singularity when attempting to run
a null model, the mixed model with only random effects.

```{r}
mixed_extract.data.frame(singular_dataset, c("y", "y1"),
              .rhs = "covar + x + (1|condition)", 
              .by_group = "x",
              .file_path = "../example_extract", .file_name = "simple_mixed")
```

Note here that the by_group comparisons are missing for `y1`. This occurs 
when the null model does not have a singualrity but a singularity is found when
running `emmeans` on the full mixed mode. When this occur, the function outputs
the information it can and then moves onto the next dependent variable. This 
also occurs if the `.alternate` argument is set to "skip".

### Alternate Method: aggregate

The other alternate method currently implemented is "aggregate". This method is
used if the dependent variable is a factor or if `.alternate` is set to
"aggregate. This method works by creating dummy variables of the categorical
response variable and then aggregating these response variable dummies by mean 
to the highest grouping level specified in the mixed model. The `.by_group` is 
made into a dummy variable. An anova comparison is made between a null model
and an effect model to obtain an effect size. The null model is a linear model
with the `.by_group` as a dependent variable and the fixed effects as
independent variables. The effect model also includes the aggregated dummy 
variables as dependent variables in the model. The effect size and means are 
calculated using the normal mixed method, or the cluster alternate method if 
necessary.

For demonstration, we will go back to the `Arabidopsis` dataset but use an 
explicit factor as our response variable.
```{r}
mixed_extract.data.frame(Arabidopsis, c("reg", "total.fruits", "total.leaves"),
              .fixed_effects = "status", 
              .random_intercept = "gen/popu",
              .by_group = "status",
              .file_path = "../example_extract",
              .file_name = "mixed_extract.data.frame_example")
```

Here a p-value is made and presented on the dependent variable as a whole. The 
effect size and means are given for the dummied variables and the method used
for these calculations is also listed.

## Support for Multiple Imputations

This function currently supports the use of a multiply imputed dataset (`mids`) 
as an input instead of a dataframe. This is still a work in progress and there 
is currently no support for the "Aggregated ANOVA Linear Comparison" alternate
method for this input type.

## Excel Output

All previous examples were made synthetically to provide reproducible examples 
you can run. The following output are made using protected data from the VIQI 
project for the purposes of demonstration.
