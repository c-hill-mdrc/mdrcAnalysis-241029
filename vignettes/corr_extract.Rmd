## Overview

`corr_extract` simplifies the creations of correlations and generates a formatted Excel
workbook summarizing the results. The correlation values are driven by
`psych::corr.test()` which is in turn driven by `stats::cor`. The function also allows for
the calculation and display of Cronbach Alphas using `psych::alpha`.

## Arguments

- `.dataset` Input tibble containing the data you wish to make an extract on

- `.vars` Character vector of variables to correlate. Will default to all numeric 
variables in `.dataset` that are not specified in `with_var` or `.by_x`

- `with_vars` Optional vector of variables to correlate against `.vars`. Intuitively,
these are the "rows" of the correlation matrix output. If unspecified, the correlation
matrix will be "square" on `.vars`.

- `.by_x` Optional string specifying variable to "split" data by. Split data is 
exported in different sheets in the output Excel workbook if exporting.

- `.impute` Logical specifying if mean imputation should be done before calculating
correlations. Defaults to `FALSE`

- `.method` Method for calculating correlations, must be one of:
  + "pearson" (Default)
  
  + "spearman"
  
  + "kendall"
  
- `.use` Method for handling missing data, must be one of:
  + "pairwise.complete.obs" (Default)
  + "all.obs"
  + "complete.obs"
  + "everything"
  + "na.or.complete"
  
  Note that you may be used to just typing in "pairwise" or "complete" when calling a
  correlation. This **IS** supported via partial matching of strings and in fact, 
  `stats::cor()` also uses the full names listed above. 
  
- `.round` Digits to round values to. Does **NOT** apply to alphas or any univariates
specified in `.stats`. Set to `NULL` if "exact" values are desired. Defaults to 4.
- `.stats` Character vector of univariate statistics to calculate and output. Can
contain any of the following:
  + "mean"
  
  + "min"
  
  + "max"
  
  + "n"
  
  + "sd"
  
  + "sum"
  
  Defaults to "mean".
  
- `.prob` Logical determining if t-test probabilty will be displayed. Calculated using
$\alpha = 0.05$. Defaults to `TRUE`

- `.nobs` Logical determining if number of observations is displayed. Defaults to `TRUE`.

- `.alpha` Logical determining if Cronbach alphas will be calculated. Defaults to `TRUE`.

- `.plot` Logical determining if Correlation plot will be added to Excel output.
Plot will be inserted into another sheet.

- `.output_path` Optional string specifying path of output excel document. If
unspecified but `.output_file` is provided, set to working directory.

- `.output_file` Optional string specifying name of output excel document.

- `.warnings` Logical determining if warnings will be printed and displayed on run.
Primarily used when knitting. Defaults to `TRUE`

## Usage

Using simulated data for demonstration.
```{r}
data("sim_data_robust_reg")
```

```{r}
# converting to numeric from character to run correlation
sim_data_robust_reg$individuals <- as.numeric(sim_data_robust_reg$individuals)
```

### Default Call
`corr_extract` will create correlations on **ALL** numeric variables if it is just called
on the dataset as such:

```{r}
corr_extract(sim_data_robust_reg)
```

Note that the correlations, probability, and number of observations is listed in a
separate row for each pairwise combination of variables. Also note that the Cronbach
Alphas are also displayed as columns but that the total alphas are constant across rows.

### Specifying Variables

You can think of `.vars` as the parameter specifying the "columns" of the correlation
matrix. If explicitly set, it will fail to run if any non-numeric columns are included.

Here individuals is a column of character values.
```{r, error = TRUE}
corr_extract(sim_data_robust_reg, .vars = c("cities", "individuals"))
```

Here, every `.vars` specified is numeric.
```{r}
corr_extract(sim_data_robust_reg, .vars = c("age_raw", "eduLevel"))
```

`.with_vars` is used if you want the "rows" of the correlation matrix to differ from the
"columns". `.with_vars` must also be numeric.

Here, the columns of the correlation matrix are "age_raw" and "eduLevel" and the rows
are "gender" and "numChild"
```{r}
corr_extract(sim_data_robust_reg,
             .vars = c("age_raw", "eduLevel"),
             .with_vars = c("gender", "numChild"))
```

If a variable is mistakenly added to both `.vars` and `.with_vars`, its placement in 
`.vars` is preferred.

```{r}
corr_extract(sim_data_robust_reg,
             .vars = c("age_raw", "eduLevel"),
             .with_vars = c("gender", "age_raw"))
```

`.by_x` effectively performs `corr_extract` on each dataframe split by the values of the
variable specified in `by_x`. Although `.by_x` can refer to any column, it is generally
recommended that it is used on factor or character variables.

See below that `.by_x` is set to "sites". This creates a new column called "sites"
that contains the current value of "sites" that the correlation result is filtered for.
```{r}
corr_extract(sim_data_robust_reg,
             .vars = c("age_raw", "eduLevel"),
             .with_vars = c("gender"),
             .by_x = "treatment")
```


### Handling Missing Values

If you want to replace missing values with the mean value of their column, set `.impute`
to `TRUE`.

```{r}
# Creating data every 3 rows are missing
sim_data_robust_reg_missing <- sim_data_robust_reg %>%
  dplyr::mutate(dplyr::across(tidyselect::everything(), 
                              ~ifelse(dplyr::row_number() %% 3 == 0, NA, .)))
```

```{r}
# Creating data every 3 rows are missing
sim_data_robust_reg_missing <- sim_data_robust_reg %>%
  dplyr::mutate(age_raw = ifelse(dplyr::row_number() %% 3 == 0, NA, age_raw))
```


Compare the "N" values here where no imputation takes place:
```{r}
corr_extract(sim_data_robust_reg_missing,
             .vars = c("age_raw", "eduLevel"),
             .with_vars = "gender")
```

With the higher "N" values where imputation does take place:
```{r}
corr_extract(sim_data_robust_reg_missing,
             .vars = c("age_raw", "eduLevel"),
             .with_vars = c("gender"),
             .impute = TRUE)
```

Missing values are also handled with `.use`. Please read the documentation for
\code{\link[stats]{cor()}} or call `?cor` in your console for more details on
how these methods handle missing values.

### What is Included in Output

The parameters `.prob`, `.nobs` control if additional rows will be attached displaying
t-test P values and the number of observations. 

See how this output only has a single row now:
```{r}
corr_extract(sim_data_robust_reg,
             .vars = c("age_raw", "eduLevel"),
             .with_vars = c("gender"),
             .prob = FALSE, .nobs = FALSE)
```

Setting `.alpha` to `FALSE` removes the 4 columns used to describe alphas:
```{r}
corr_extract(sim_data_robust_reg,
             .vars = c("age_raw", "eduLevel"),
             .with_vars = c("gender"),
             .prob = FALSE, .nobs = FALSE,
             .alpha = FALSE)
```

And `.stats` controls other univariates displayed. This can be reduced to none:
```{r}
corr_extract(sim_data_robust_reg,
             .vars = c("age_raw", "eduLevel"),
             .with_vars = c("gender"),
             .prob = FALSE, .nobs = FALSE,
             .alpha = FALSE,
             .stats = NA_character_)
```

Or can include any combination of the options listed above:
```{r}
corr_extract(sim_data_robust_reg,
             .vars = c("age_raw", "eduLevel"),
             .with_vars = c("gender"),
             .prob = FALSE, .nobs = FALSE,
             .alpha = FALSE,
             .stats = c("min", "max", "sum"))
```

## Excel Output

Excel output can be specified by the `.output_file` name. The path can also be explicitly
specified with `.output_path`. If the path is not explicitly used, it will first check
to see if a path is already in `.output_file`, e.g. if you pass
"/data/share/my_output.xlsx" for `.output_file`, then "/data/share" will be the path and 
the file name will be "my_output.xlsx". If no path can be found, it will use the current
working directory. In .Rmd files, this is the same path that the .Rmd is stored in. In
.R files or in console calls, this is whatever path is seen at the top of your console
and can be seen by calling `getwd()`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
corr_extract(sim_data_robust_reg,
             .vars = c("age_raw", "eduLevel"),
             .with_vars = c("gender"),
             .output_path = "../example_extract",
             .output_file = "corr_extract_example")
```

TODO: Once output columns are standardized, include screenshots to keep in vignette.
