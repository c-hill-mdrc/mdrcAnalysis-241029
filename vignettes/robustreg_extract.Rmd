### Simulated data

It is the year 2050. The AI revolution is almost complete. Troves of workers across sectors & educational qualifications have been unemployed. The federal government along with the premier research agency, mdrc is partnering to evaluate job retraining programs and whether the specialized empathy & listening training (treatment) increases the chance of people being employed in new human care industries that have propped up. An initial trial has been conducted across 5 cities in multiple sites with 1-25 individuals in each training site.

The initial simulated data set is a 3 level data structure consisting of

* **City** - 5 Cities with population between 1,000 and 2,000
* **Sites** - Within each city, there are between 1-10 job training centers
* **Individuals** - Within each job training center, there are 1-25 trainees/individuals

Additionally, we are assuming that people with prior higher education has higher prior income
and have put a correlation structure around it. 
Furthermore, we think that married and single people live in distinct clusters within this data set. 
In our example below, we have set the clustering at the sites level.

```{r}
library(mdrcAnalysis)
data("sim_data_robust_reg")
```

```{r}
head(sim_data_robust_reg)
```

## Minimum Arguments

`surveyreg_extract` requires that you pass it the data, the treatment variable, 
and a vector of dependent variables. Without a `.ByX` variable set, this
generates a single row for each `.DepVars` and displays adjusted means and 
impacts based on the linear model generated as well as the unadjusted statistics.

```{r}
robustreg_extract(sim_data_robust_reg,
                  .TmntVar = "treatment",
                  .DepVars = "employed_01")
```

This function does allow for passing of multiple treatment variables and will
generate rows for each combination of `.TmntVar` and `.DepVars`

```{r}
robustreg_extract(sim_data_robust_reg,
                  .TmntVar = "treatment",
                  .DepVars = c("employed_01",
                               "employed_02"))
```

## Adjusting the Model

The model being calculated uses the `.DepVar` as the dependent variable in the
linear model and `.TmntVar` as a covariate. If you wish to add more covariates,
add these as a vector of the variable names into the `.CoVars` argument.

The model created can be seen byt looking at the column "Equations"

```{r}
robustreg_extract(sim_data_robust_reg,
                  .TmntVar = "treatment",
                  .DepVars = c("employed_01",
                               "employed_02"),
                  .CoVars = c("eduLevel", "age_scaled"),
                  .asfactorcovs = c("eduLevel"))
```

There are also 2 options for the calculation of standard errors: `.ClusterVar`. and `.RobustSE`. 
`.ClusterVar`. supersedes `.RobustSE`.in priority if both are set. 
`.ClusterVar`. takes the name of a variable to cluster by, using the "HC1", 
degrees of freedom-based correction bias adjustment. 
If `.RobustSE`. is run, then there is no clustering of standard errors but the "HC1" correction is still
applied. There is no column displaying if `.RobustSE` is TRUE or FALSE although
the column `NClusters` does display how many distinct clusters there are based
on the variable passed. 

We can also output this extract into an excel file.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
robustreg_withCluster <-
  robustreg_extract(sim_data_robust_reg
                    ,.TmntVar = "treatment"
                    ,.DepVars = c("employed_01",
                                  "employed_02")
                    ,.ByX = c("eduLevel")
                    ,.ClusterVar = "sites"
                    # ,.output_path = "../example_extract"
                    # ,.output_file = "robust_reg_extract_example"
                    )

robustreg_withCluster %>%
  dplyr::relocate(UniqueId) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(UniqueId)
```
